Dear {{ticket.requester.name}},

Thank you for uploading your paper. {% if ticket.ticket_field_24117286 == '1' %}Because it was accepted by the journal more than 3 months ago, I'm afraid we can't make it comply with the [HEFCE Open Access policy](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/rsrch/oa/Policy/). This requires that manuscripts are submitted to us within a maximum of 3 months from the acceptance date. {% if ticket.ticket_field_77355348 == '1' %}During the first two years of the policy (1 April 2016 â€“ 1 April 2018), outputs can be deposited up to three months after the date of publication, so this article will still be eligible for the REF, but this flexibility will be subject to a review in autumn 2017.{% endif %} 

W{% else %} To comply with the [HEFCE Open Access policy](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/rsrch/oa/Policy/) w{% endif %}e can add your manuscript to [Apollo](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/), the University's institutional repository{% if ticket.ticket_field_77352028 == blank %}, with an embargo until publication{% else %}{% if ticket.ticket_field_24072173 != '0_months' and ticket.ticket_field_24072173 != blank %}, with a {{ ticket.ticket_field_24072173 | remove:'_months' }}-month embargo{% endif %}{% endif %}. We'll let you know when we've done this.

#### Wellcome Trust Open Access sanctions for non-compliance

Where Wellcome-funded researchers have not complied with the Trust's Open Access policy, [three sanctions will apply](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/complying-our-open-access-policy):

1. Applicants will be required to ensure that Wellcome-funded publications resulting from current or previous grants are compliant before formal notification of any funding renewals or new grants can be issued.
2. Researchers will not be permitted to include any non-compliant Wellcome-funded publications in any application submitted to us. Such publications will be removed from the application and discounted when we consider a researcher's track record.
3. Where non-compliant publications are identified in an end of grant report, the Trust will withhold the final 10 per cent of the 'total transferable funds' budget on the grant until all papers comply. [See our 10 per cent retention policy.](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/10-cent-retention-policy)

These sanctions apply to:

* all original Wellcome-funded research papers published since 1 October 2009
* to monographs and book chapters for which a contract was signed after 1 October 2014.
