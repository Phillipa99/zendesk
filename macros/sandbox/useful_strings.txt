##WHAT RCUK AND COAF CONSISTS OF
As this is a completely Open Access journal, the publisher will probably charge an Open Access fee for this paper. I'm afraid that we won't be able to pay it if so, as we only receive grants to pay for research funded by RCUK or COAF.

RCUK comprises: AHRC, BBSRC, EPSRC, ESRC, NERC, MRC, STFC
COAF comprises: Arthritis UK, Bloodwise, British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK, Parkinsonâ€™s UK, Wellcome Trust.
