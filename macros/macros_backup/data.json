The European Research Council require articles and monographs – and associated research data – to be made available within six months of publication for sciences. This is extended to 12 months for arts, humanities and social sciences. **Open access fees are eligible costs that can be charged against ERC grants, provided they are incurred during the duration of the project**. More information on their policy is available on the [ERC website](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC_Open_Access_Guidelines-revised_feb_2016.pdf).
