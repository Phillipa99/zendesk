Where Wellcome-funded researchers have not complied with the Trust's Open Access policy, [three sanctions will apply](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/complying-our-open-access-policy):

1. Applicants will be required to ensure that Wellcome-funded publications resulting from current or previous grants are compliant before formal notification of any funding renewals or new grants can be issued.
2. Researchers will not be permitted to include any non-compliant Wellcome-funded publications in any application submitted to us. Such publications will be removed from the application and discounted when we consider a researcher's track record.
3. Where non-compliant publications are identified in an end of grant report, the Trust will withhold the final 10 per cent of the 'total transferable funds' budget on the grant until all papers comply. [See our 10 per cent retention policy.](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/10-cent-retention-policy)

These sanctions apply to:

* all original Wellcome-funded research papers published since 1 October 2009
* to monographs and book chapters for which a contract was signed after 1 October 2014.
